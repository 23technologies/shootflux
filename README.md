# Example Git repository for the [gardener-extension-shoot-flux](https://github.com/23technologies/gardener-extension-shoot-flux)

This repo just contains a very simple example for the configuration of `Shoot` clusters using the [gardener-extension-shoot-flux](https://github.com/23technologies/gardener-extension-shoot-flux).
Using this repo in combination with the extension will result in `Shoot` clusters being created with [Podinfo](https://github.com/stefanprodan/podinfo) installed.
